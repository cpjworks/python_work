# 5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, 
# and write an if-else chain.

# • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just 
# earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
# • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just 
# earned 10 points.

alien = "green" 
if alien == "green":
    print("You just got yourself 5 points!")
else:
    print("Wow! 10 points! Keep going!")

# • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that
# runs the else block.

alien = "yellow" 
if alien == "green":
    print("You just got yourself 5 points!")
else:
    print("Wow! 10 points! Keep going!")

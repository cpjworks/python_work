# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
# Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 
# 'yellow', or 'red'.

alien_colour = "red"

# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. 

if alien_colour == "green":
    print("The alien is still alive. Shoot it down, now!")

# If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
# fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

if alien_colour == "red":
    print("The alien has been eliminated. Congratulations!")

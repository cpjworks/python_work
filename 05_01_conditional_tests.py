# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a 
# statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each 
# test. Your code should look something like this:

# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')

# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
# another five tests evaluate to False.

food = "pizza"
print("Is food == 'pizza'? I predict True.")
print(food == "pizza")
print("\nIs food == 'bread'? I predict False")
print(food == "bread")

# I understand this so I am not going to spend time writing 8 more tests.
